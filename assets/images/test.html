<h2 class="chapTitle">Weakling</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Xiao Zhan POV</strong></p>
<p>Prince Yibo is the future alpha.
I, on the other hand, is nothing but is the total opposite, a nerd weak omega, when the other kids turned 4 years they were able to have their first transformation but someone like me, I'm already 15 years but I'm not even sure if I was cursed or not, with my weak body structure someone will easily tell that I am an omega, tests at the hospital showed that I am an omega.</p>
<p>I couldn't transform like other children when my age mates go out to the woods for a run, here I am just being the laughing stock of the pack, hurtful words were branded to me, getting bullied by everyone in the pack and no one will come out to at least defend me when I'm being used as a punching bag but rather they will encourage whoever it was that has decided to relieve his stress to take it out all on me.</p>
<p>"Look at you, are you really a wolf or maybe your parents just pitied you and took you in! You're a disgrace from our pack! You don't deserve to be in this pack, can't you just get lost" In omega girl who is the same age as me spatted, but what could do, it's better to just keep quiet, because if I dare to say a word then it will be worse than just those hurtful words.</p>
<p>ã€€
"Don't be sad, I am always here with you, I will never leave you.
My wolf said.</p>
<p>'But what they have said is the truth, I couldn't even transform like the other's, it's true I am a disgrace.' I answered sadly, why didn't I just be like the others live a normal without getting bullied. Everything will be alright when the right time comes. I'm sure our mate will never despise us. My wolf encouraged us, but by the thought of finding out mate terrified me even more.</p>
<p>"Move aside you little punk!" A deep voice shouted and I have roughly pushed away, I hit my head with the wall, whimpered and winced in pain, lifting my eye's my eyes met with our future alpha who smirked, he's one of my bullies and his insults were more hurtful, it hurts more when your future leader encourages and even join to bully a member of the pack Instead of protecting them.</p>
<p>"Why are you looking at me with those eyes, how dare you look at your alpha like that!" Yibo added and kicked Xiao Zhan on his stomach, Zhan who was already sitting on the floor groaned in pain and hugged his stomach which felt like the organs have been crushed into pieces, Zhan vomited portion his undigested lunch. The students nearby started laughing while looking at xiao Zhan with pure disgust.</p>
<p>.
.
.
"Your such a disgust! Weakling! A real shame!"
Another shouted and poured cold water at the already trembling Xiao Zhan. As it was already winter, the weather was really cold, he's sure he's going to get a cold.</p>
